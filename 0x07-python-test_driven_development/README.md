## Description
This project's purpose is to practice Test-Driven Development. Every task is composed of one script, and one corresponding test file for this script. The doctests can be run with `python3 -m doctest ./tests/*`.

The unittest can be run with `python3 -m unittest tests.6-max_integer_test`.
