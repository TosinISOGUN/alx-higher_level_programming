# Python - Object-relational mapping
## Synopsis
An object-relational mapper (ORM) is a code library that automates the transfer of data stored in relational database tables into objects that are more commonly used in application code.

## Why are ORMs useful?
ORMs provide a high-level abstraction upon a relational database that allows a developer to write Python code instead of SQL to create, read, update and delete data and schemas in their database. Developers can use the programming language they are comfortable with to work with a database instead of writing SQL statements or stored procedures.

## Requirements & Environment
- Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`.
- All files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using `python3` (version 3.8.5)
- All files will be executed with `MySQLdb` version `2.0.x`.
- All files will be executed with `SQLAlchemy` version `1.4.x`.
- The first line of all files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/python3`.
- A `README.md` file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory.
- All files must be executable.
